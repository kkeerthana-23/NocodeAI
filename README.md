# ü§ñ My AI Projects & Learning Hub

Welcome to my personal AI workspace ‚Äî a curated, practical collection of tools, concepts, and use cases I'm exploring to better understand and apply artificial intelligence in real-world business contexts.

I‚Äôm an account manager in fintech, and this repo is where I:
- Try out AI tools that simplify work
- Track new tech like AI agents
- Capture use cases across operations, onboarding, and communication
- Stay sharp in a fast-changing space üöÄ

## üß† Key Concepts & Definitions

- **LLM (Large Language Model)**  
  A type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand, generate, and summarize human language. Examples include GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini.

- **MCP (Model-Chain-Prompt)**  
  A simple framework for thinking about how AI applications are structured:  
  - **Model:** The brain (e.g., GPT-4)  
  - **Chain:** The logic/workflow connecting multiple steps  
  - **Prompt:** The instruction or input given to the model

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  The practice of crafting high-quality inputs (prompts) to get better outputs from language models.

- **AI Agent**  
  A system that uses an LLM (or multiple tools) to perform tasks autonomously based on goals, memory, and feedback.

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  A technique where the AI fetches external data (like documents or websites) and combines it with its model knowledge to answer more accurately.

- **No-Code AI Tools**  
  Platforms that let non-technical users build AI-powered solutions without writing code. Examples: Zapier, Softr, Lovable, and Airtable.

- **Use Case**  
  A specific scenario where AI can be applied to solve a real-world problem, like automating customer onboarding or summarizing legal contracts.

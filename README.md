# 🧠 AI in Fintech – Explorations by KK

Hi! I'm a fintech account manager exploring how artificial intelligence can drive smarter solutions for clients, processes, and products.

This repository is a personal learning journal and resource hub. It’s designed to track what I learn, tools I try, and how I apply AI concepts—especially in non-technical, business-first contexts.

I’m not a developer—but I’m hands-on with AI tools, curious about real use cases, and experimenting with no-code solutions.

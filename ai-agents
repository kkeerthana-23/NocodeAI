# 🤖 AI Agents: Automating Workflows with Intelligence

AI Agents are systems that don't just answer — they act.  
They can read, plan, decide, and execute tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.

## 🧠 What Is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is like a digital assistant that can:
- Understand tasks or goals
- Make decisions or plans
- Take actions (e.g., send an email, update a database, trigger workflows)

Unlike traditional automation, agents are often adaptive, context-aware, and goal-driven.

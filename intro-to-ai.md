## 🤖 What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence: understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, or even interacting in conversation.

The most visible types of AI today include:
- **Generative AI**: Tools like ChatGPT and Claude that create text, code, or content
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms that learn from data and improve over time
- **AI Agents**: Tools that can take autonomous actions across systems or apps
